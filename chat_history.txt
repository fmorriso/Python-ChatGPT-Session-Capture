If you are not using Maven or Gradle, you can manually add the necessary dependencies for Jackson and the MongoDB Java driver to your project.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Jackson in Java to read/write POJO's to a MongoDB Atlas collection without using Maven or Gradle:

1. Download the Jackson and MongoDB Java driver JAR files from their respective websites and add them to your project's classpath.

2. Create a simple POJO class that represents the structure of your MongoDB documents. Make sure to annotate the class and its fields with Jackson annotations, such as `@JsonProperty`, as needed.

```java
public class MyDocument {
    @JsonProperty("_id")
    private ObjectId id;
    
    @JsonProperty("name")
    private String name;
    
    // constructor, getters, setters
}
```

3. Create a MongoDB connection using the MongoClient class provided by the MongoDB Java driver. Make sure to replace the connection string with your own MongoDB Atlas connection string.

```java
MongoClientURI uri = new MongoClientURI("YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING");
MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(uri);
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("your_db_name");
MongoCollection<MyDocument> collection = database.getCollection("your_collection_name", MyDocument.class);
```

4. Use the ObjectMapper class provided by Jackson to serialize and deserialize your POJOs.

```java
// Serialize POJO to JSON and insert into MongoDB collection
MyDocument document = new MyDocument();
document.setName("John Doe");
String json = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(document);
collection.insertOne(Document.parse(json));

// Read from MongoDB collection and deserialize into POJO
MyDocument result = collection.find().first();
MyDocument deserialized = new ObjectMapper().readValue(result.toJson(), MyDocument.class);
```

5. Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during the read/write operations, such as IOException or MongoException.

And that's it! You should now be able to use Jackson in Java to read/write POJO's to a MongoDB Atlas collection without using Maven or Gradle.
